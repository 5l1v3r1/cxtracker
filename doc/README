#### USE ###

### cxtracker.pl (The perl version)
Currently you can use it just to see or record your connections on
your network. I use it now instead of sancp in my sguil setup.
See '$ cxtracker.pl --help' for updated info
cxtracker.pl --help
Usage:
     $ cxtracker.pl [options]

     OPTIONS:

     --dev|-d       : network device (default: eth0)
     --sguil        : enables sguil output and sets output dir
     --daemon       : enables daemon mode
     --debug        : enable debug messages (default: 0 (disabled))
     --help         : this help message
     --version      : show cxtracker.pl version

# Examples
To just try out and see whats going on on your network (wlan0):
$ ./cxtracker.pl --dev wlan0

To have it work with sguil, sending it to daemon world, using eth0:
$ ./cxtracker.pl --dev eth0 --daemon --sguil /sguil_data/`hostname -s`/sancp/
