for profiling, history, auditing and network discovery. It can be used 
as an replacement for sancp in the sguil setup. It handles vlan (2 layers)
and IPv6 out of the box.

#### USE ###

### cxtracker (The C version)
I use it now instead of sancp in my sguil setup.
See '$ cxtracker --help' for updated info
cxtracker --help
Usage:
     $ cxtracker [options]

     OPTIONS:

     -i             : network device (default: eth0)
     -b             : berkeley packet filter
     -d             : directory to dump sessions files in
     -u             : user
     -g             : group
     -D             : enables daemon mode
     -h             : this help message
     -v             : verbose
#     -V             : show cxtracker.pl version

# Example
Running cxtracker in forground:
 Only IPv4 traffic:
 ./cxtracker -d /nsm_data/sensor1/sancp -u nsm -g nsm -i eth1 -b 'ip'

 Only VLAN and IPv4 traffic:
 ./cxtracker -d /nsm_data/sensor1/sancp -u nsm -g nsm -i eth1 -b 'vlan and ip'

 vlan and IPv4 and IPv6:
 ./cxtracker -d /nsm_data/sensor1/sancp -u nsm -g nsm -i eth1



### cxtracker.pl (The perl version) Just a proofe of concept..
### Dont use in prod :)
Currently you can use it just to see or record your connections on
your network.
See '$ cxtracker.pl --help' for updated info
cxtracker.pl --help
Usage:
     $ cxtracker.pl [options]

     OPTIONS:

     --dev|-d       : network device (default: eth0)
     --sguil        : enables sguil output and sets output dir
     --daemon       : enables daemon mode
     --debug        : enable debug messages (default: 0 (disabled))
     --help         : this help message
     --version      : show cxtracker.pl version

# Examples
To just try out and see whats going on on your network (wlan0):
$ ./cxtracker.pl --dev wlan0

To have it work with sguil, sending it to daemon world, using eth0:
$ ./cxtracker.pl --dev eth0 --daemon --sguil /sguil_data/`hostname -s`/sancp/
